% Notes on compiling Document
%
% 1. Each chapter can be compiled on there own.
% 2. I set the document up with a common figures folder to allow for the reuse of figures and generally to keep the document clean. 
% 3. When compiling the main document, you must include the \graphicspath{{xx}} for the first chapter, to set it in Chapter 1. From here on, it will think it is in the chapter one folder but the <../figures> in each folder will work with this. 
% 4. I (Austin Downey) have gotten this to compile on Windows with MikTeX and Linux with TeXLive. Your results may vary. For Linux, I:
% 	i.	added the extra {} in \graphicspath
% 	ii.	removed the .tex extension from the file names except for Chapter 1. 
% 5. The common bibliography is an issue that has yet to be sorted out. Currently citing sources in footnotes.

\section*{Preface}

This open-source text is designed to offer the reader a complete text on the basics of control theory within the contest of Mechanical Engineering. 


\subsection*{Cover Art}
Union Pacific No. 119 is a replica of the 4-4-0 ``American'' type steam locomotive that participated in the Golden Spike ceremony at Promontory Summit, Utah, on May 10, 1869, marking the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. The original locomotive was built in 1868 by Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works for the Union Pacific Railroad and was scrapped in 1903. The replica on the cover was built by O'Connor Engineering Laboratories and delivered to Promontory in 1979. The  transcontinental railroad represents a significant milestone in industrial development and the practical applications of control theory.
