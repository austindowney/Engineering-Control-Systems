% Notes on compiling Document
%
% 1. Each chapter can be compiled on there own.
% 2. I set the document up with a common figures folder to allow for the reuse of figures and generally to keep the document clean. 
% 3. When compiling the main document, you must include the \graphicspath{{xx}} for the first chapter, to set it in Chapter 1. From here on, it will think it is in the chapter one folder but the <../figures> in each folder will work with this. 
% 4. I (Austin Downey) have gotten this to compile on Windows with MikTeX and Linux with TeXLive. Your results may vary. For Linux, I:
% 	i.	added the extra {} in \graphicspath
% 	ii.	removed the .tex extension from the file names except for Chapter 1. 
% 5. The common bibliography is an issue that has yet to be sorted out. Currently citing sources in footnotes.

\section*{Preface}

This open-source text is designed to offer the reader a complete text on the basics of control theory within the contest of Mechanical Engineering. 


\subsection*{Cover Art}
A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is a feed-back controller used in a variety of applications that require continuously modulated control. The Russian American engineer Nicolas Minorsky was arguably the first to develop the theoretical analysis of the PID controller in 1922  while he was researching and designing automatic ship steering for the US Navy. He based his work on watching how a ship's helmsman responds to wave loading on a ship, with a delayed input to the helm that not only considered the current ship course, but also past error and the desired rate of change for the ship. For a helmsman, the goal is stability, not absolute control, which simplifies how one thinks about the challenge of control.
